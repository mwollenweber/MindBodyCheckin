# EasyGymCheckin
EasyGymCheckin is a Django webapp wrapper for the MindBody API to facilitate checking in to a MindyBody gym without
logging in. EasyGymCheckin allows a client to check in to MindBody via their phone without an app. We perform basic sanity
checking that the class is available, the student it active, the class time is soon, and that the student is near the gym
